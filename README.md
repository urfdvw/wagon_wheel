# simulation of wagon wheel effect

This is a simulation of sampling of a rotating wheel.

The web app is ready to use at: https://urfdvw.github.io/wagon_wheel/

I have to say, simulation of sampling on a computer screen is not a good ideal. Because the screen itself have a sampling frequency.
As a result, the sampling rate can not go very high, mostly not above 5 for such a web based animation.
On the other hand, the FPS of the animation is floating, so the sampled result is not very stable.
